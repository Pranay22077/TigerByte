# TigerByte Concepts

## 🧭 Project Vision
TigerByte aims to make programming fun, approachable, and multilingual — blending language learning and logical thinking into one playful experience.  

Its design encourages experimentation, reading code aloud in multiple languages, and learning programming through creativity.

---

## 🧱 Design Philosophy
- **Multilingual Simplicity:** Core commands exist in English, Mandarin, and German.  
- **Readability:** Code should feel like storytelling — simple, direct, and expressive.  
- **Playful Learning:** Encourage experimentation through intuitive syntax and humor.  

---

## Core Idea
A toy programming language that supports multilingual commands (English, Mandarin, German).

## Example Commands
- `feed` / `喂` / `füttern`
- `chase` / `追` / `jagen`
- `say` / `说` / `sagen`

## Notes
- Focus on clarity, simplicity, and learning
- Keep syntax clean and theme-consistent

## 📅 October 19, 2025 — Initial File System Design

Today marks an important step in the TigerByte project.  
The core file structure for the toy programming language has been decided.  
Each file extension represents a part of TigerByte’s playful yet functional identity.

---

## 🧩 TigerByte File System Design

| Emoji | Extension | Purpose | Example |
|:--:|:--:|:--|:--|
| 🐯 | `.tbyte` | **Main source code files** — written in TigerByte syntax. | `hello_world.tbyte` |
| 🐾 | `.cub` | **Example/tutorial files** — beginner programs or demos. | `learn_feed.cub` |
| 📣 | `.roar` | **Output/log files** — stores printed output or execution logs. | `run_output.roar` |
| 🏠 | `.den` | **Configuration/environment files** — settings or runtime configs. | `settings.den` |

---

### 💡 Design Notes
- **Consistency:** All extensions are short, easy to type, and fit the Tiger theme.  
- **Scalability:** Future tools (interpreters, linters, or compilers) can easily recognize `.tbyte` as the core language file.  
- **Fun factor:** Emojis and names are approachable, encouraging creativity and exploration.  

---

### 🪄 Next Step Ideas
1. Begin sketching out TigerByte **keywords** (e.g. `feed`, `roar`, `chase`).  
2. Decide on **comment syntax** (e.g. `#`, `//`, or something unique).  
3. Write the first pseudo “Hello World” program concept in `.tbyte` format.  
4. Add version details to `CHANGELOG.md` for today’s progress.
